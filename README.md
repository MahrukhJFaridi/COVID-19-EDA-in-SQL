# COVID-19-EDA-in-SQL
In this SQL project, I conducted an in-depth exploratory analysis of COVID-19 deaths, leveraging a comprehensive database. Employing advanced SQL techniques including aggregate functions and type casting, I calculated the likelihood of mortality upon contracting COVID-19, as well as the percentage of the population diagnosed with the virus. Additionally, I identified nations with the highest infection rates relative to their populations.

Furthermore, I utilized joins to determine the percentage of individuals sent to intensive care units (ICUs) out of all patients in the United States. Employing common table expressions (CTEs) and temporary tables, I analyzed the percentage of the population in each country that received at least one vaccine dose.

Moreover, I employed views in SQL to facilitate data visualization in Tableau, enabling the creation of insightful visualizations to illustrate key findings and trends in COVID-19 data."
